jaspar stats
============

The `JASPAR motifs` were downloaded from [Jaspar](http://jaspar.genereg.net/downloads/) choosing `JASPAR2018_CORE_vertebrates_non-redundant` in `MEME` format. Because there is no gene ids provided in the Jaspar database, the corresponding gene's `Ensembl ID` was fatched by querying the provided `UniprotID` from [UniprotID](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/) using a customized function `getEnsemblFromJaspar` [code](./aux_funs.R).

-   number of TF motifs in Jaspar

<!-- -->

    ## [1] 579

-   How many of them are protein complex?

<!-- -->

    ## [1] 45

tfclass stats
=============

[TFclass database](http://tfclass.bioinf.med.uni-goettingen.de/about.jsf) were downloaded (2018-05-14), [parsed](./scripts/parseTfclassTTL.sh) and [extacted](./scripts/tfclass.R) the human and mouse genes' Ensembl ID.

-   How many unique genus (i.e. TF genes) in parsed TFClass?

<!-- -->

    ## [1] 1440

-   How many subfamilies in parsed TFClass?

<!-- -->

    ## [1] 396

-   How many families in parsed TFClass?

<!-- -->

    ## [1] 110

-   There are two tfs have no family info in TFClass db:

jaspar-tfclass dictionary stats
===============================

`JASPAR` and `TFClass` were majorly [mapped](./cmpDB.R) by matching `Ensembl ID` except `20` TFs by `TF Name` directly.
